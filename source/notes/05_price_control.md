> **Misconception** - Rent controls help make housing more affordable for everyone.

###  When Do Price Ceilings Matter?
+ **Price controls** attempt to set prices through government involvement in the market.
+ A **price ceiling** is a legally established maximum price for a good or service.
+ **Black market** is illegal markets that arise when price controls are in place.

#### Understanding Price Ceilings
To help disadvantaged, legislators pass a law stating that no one can charge more than \$0.5 for a loaf of bread. (this price ceiling is about one-third the typical price of a loaf of generic white bread.

Table 5.1
A Price Ceiling on Bread
| Question |  Answer/Explanation | Result |
|:----------|:---------------------|:--------|
| Will there be more bread or less bread for sale? | Consumers will want to buy more because the price is lower (the law of demand), but producers will manufacture less (the law of supply). The net result will be a shortage of bread. | Empty Shelves|
| Will the size of a typical loaf of bread change? | Because the price is capped at \$0.5 per load, manufacturers will try to maintain profits by reducing the size of each loaf. | No more giant bread. |
| Will the quality change? | Because the price is capped, producers will use cheaper ingredients, and many expensive brands and varieties will no longer profitable to produce. Thus the quality of available bread will decline. | Focaccia bread will disappear. |
| Will the opportunity cost of finding bread change ?| The opportunity cost of finding bread will rise. Consumers will spend significant resources going from store to store to see if a bread shipment has arrived and waiting in long line for a change to get some. | Bread lines will become the norm. |
| Will people break the law to buy bread? | Because bread will be hard to find and people still need it, a black market will develop. Those selling and buying on the black market will be breaking the law.| Black market dealers will help reduce the shortage. |

#### The Effect Of Price Ceilings
* Nonbinding Price Ceilings
When a price ceiling is above the equilibrium price, we say it is *nonbinding*. The price ceiling does not influence the market. As long as the equilibrium price remains below the price ceiling, price will continue to be regulated by supply and demand.

**Figure 5.1 A Nonbinding price ceiling**

* Binding Price Ceilings
When a price ceiling is below the market price, it creates a binding constraint that prevents supply and demand from clearing the market. The prices ceiling is binding.
The price ceiling has created two unintended consequences: a smaller quantity of bread supplied and a higher price for those who purchase it on the black market.

**Figure 5.2 The Effect of a Binding price ceiling in the Short Run**

#### Price Ceilings in the Long Run
In the long run, supply and demand become more elastic, or flatter.

###  When Effects Do Price Ceilings Have on Economic Activity?

#### Rent Control
**Rent Control** is a price ceiling that applies to the market of apartment rentals.
> In Mumbai, India, many rent-controlled buildings have dilapidated. (low profit -> ill-maintained building -> tragic consequences every monsoon season.)
>

#### Price Gouging
+ **Price gouging laws** places a temporary ceiling on the prices that seller can charge during times of emergency.

Figure 5.5
**Price Gouging**
Price gouging laws serve as a nonbinding price ceiling during normal times. However, when a natural disaster strikes, price gouging laws go into effect, the demand curve for generator shifts to the right as a result of the natural disaster, causing the new equilibrium price (E_after) to rise above the legal limit. The result is a shortage. When the emergency is lifted, the market demand returns to normal, and the temporary shortage created by price gouging legislation is eliminated.

###  When Do Price Floors Matter?
+ A **price floor** is a legally established minimum price for a good or service.

> A politician suggests we should encourage dairy farmers to produce more milk so that supplies will be plentiful and everyone will get enough calcium. To accomplish these goals, the government sets a price floor of \$6 per gallon-about twice the price of a typical gallon of fat-free milk-to make production more attractive to milk producers, What repercussions should we expect?

#### Understanding Price Floors

Table 5.2
| Questions | Answer/Explanation | Result |
|:----------|:-------------------|:-------|
|Will the quantity of milk for sale change? | Consumer will purchase less because the price is higher (the law of demand), but producers will manufacture more (the law of supply). The net result will be a surplus of milk. | There will be a surplus of milk. |
| Would producers sell below the price floor? | Yes. A surplus of milk would give sellers a strong incentive to undercut the price floor to avoid having to discard leftover milk. | Illegal discounts will help reduce the milk surplus. |
| Will dairy farmers be better off? | Not if they have trouble selling what they produce. | There might be a log of spoiled milk. |

#### The Effect Of Price Floors

##### Nonbinding Price Floors
Figure 5.6
**A Nonbinding Price Floor**
Under a nonbinding price floor, price is regulated by supply and demand. Because the price floor (\$2) is below the equilibrium price (\$3), the market will voluntarily charge more than the legal minimum. Therefore, this nonbinding price floor will have no effect on sales and purchase of milk.

##### Binding Price Floors
Figure 5.7
**A Binding Price Floor**
A binding price floor creates a surplus, which has two unintended consequences: (1) a smaller quantity demanded than the equilibrium quantity (Q_Dsr < Q_Esr) and (2) a lower black-market price to eliminate the glut of the product.

#### Price Floors in the Long Run.
Figure 5.8
**The Effect of Binding Price Floor in the Long Run**
When a price floor is left in place over time, supply and demand both become more elastic. The result is a larger surplus (Q_SLR > Q_DLR) in the long run. Because sellers are unable to sell all that they produce at \$6 per gallon, a black market develops to eliminate the glut of milk.

###  When Effects Do Price Floors Have on Economic Activity?
#### The Minimum Wage
+ The **minimum wage** is the lowest hourly wage rate that firms may legally pay their workers.

Figure 5.9
**Price Floor and a Binding Minimum Wage Market in the Short Run and Long Run**
A binding minimum wage is a price floor above the current equilibrium wage, W_E. At \$10 per hour, the number of workers willing to supply their labor ($S_{SR}$) is greater than the demand of workers ($D_{SR}$). The result is a surplus of workers (which we recognize as unemployment ). Because the supply of workers both become more elastic in the long run, unemployment expands ($Q_{SLR} > Q_{DLR}$).

#### The Minimum Wage is Often Nonbinding
Figure 5.10
**A Nonbinding Minimum wage**
An increase in the minimum wage from \$7 to $9 remains nonbinding. Therefore, it will not change the demand for labor or the unemployment rate. If the minimum wage rises above the market wage, unemployment will occur.
