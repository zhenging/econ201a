##### Historical Unemployment Rates
> Figure 7.5 Unemployment in the United States, December 2014
To compute the unemployment rate, we divide the work-eligible population between those are in the labor force and those who are not. To be counted in the labor force, a person must either have a job or be actively seeking job. The unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.

**Work-Eligible Population(Civilian, Noninstitutionized, Age 16\+)**

* Not in the labor force

	1. retirees
	2. students
	3. disabilities
	4. homestay parents
	5. discouraged workers

* Labor Force
