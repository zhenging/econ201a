<blockquote>
<p><strong>Misconception</strong> - Sellers determine the price of the good.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What Are the Fundamentals of Markets?</h3>
<p>In a <strong>market economy</strong>, resources are allocated among households and firms with little or no government interference.<br />
The <strong>invisible hand</strong> is a phrase coined by Adam Smith to refer to the unobservable market force that guide resources to their highest-valued use.</p>
<h4>Competetive Markets</h4>
<p>A <strong>competetive market</strong> exists when there are so many buyers and sellers that each has only a small (negligible) impact on the market price and output.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sales of salmon at Pike Place Market</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Imperfect Markets</h4>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>imperfect market</strong> is a market in which either the buyer or the seller can influence the market price.</li>
<li><strong>Market power</strong> is a firm's ability to influence the price of a good or service by exercising control over its demand, supply, or both.</li>
<li>A <strong>monopoly</strong> exists when a single company supplies the entire market for a particular good or service.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Gas station at a busy interstate exit</li>
<li>A furniture store in an isolated small town.</li>
<li>A fresh produce stand at a farmes' market.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h3>What determines demands?</h3>
<p>In economics, the amount of a good or service that buyers are <strong>willing and able to purchase</strong> at the current price is known as the <strong>quantity demanded</strong>.<br />
The <strong>law of demand</strong> states that, all other things being equal, quantity demanded falls when the price rises, and rises when the price falls.</p>
<h4>The Demand Curve</h4>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>demand curve</strong> is a graph of the relationship between the prices in the demand schedule and the quantity demanded at those prices.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Market Demand</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>market demand</strong> is the sum of all the individual quantity demanded by each buyer in a market at each price.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Shift of Demand Curve</h4>
<p>A price change causes a movement along a given demand curve, but it cannot cause a shift of the demand curve.</p>
<p>Figure 3.3<br />
<strong>A Shift or the Demand Curve</strong><br />
When the price changes, the quantity demanded changes along the demand curve, as indicated by the orange arrow. A shift of the demand curve, indicated by the black arrows, occurs when something other than price changes.<br />
<strong>Shift to the left</strong>: A health warning causes buyers to demand fewer cantaloupes.<br />
<strong>Shift to the right</strong>: A medical study reports that eating cantaloupe lowers cholesterol, which cause buyers to demand more cantaloupe.</p>
<p>1. Change in Buyer's Income</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purchasing power</strong> is the value of your income expressed in terms of how much you can afford.</li>
<li>Consumers buy more of a <strong>normal good</strong> as income rises, holding all other factors constant.</li>
<li>An <strong>interior good</strong> is purchased out of necessity rater than choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. The Price of Related Goods</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complements</strong> are two goods that are used together. When the price of a complementary good rises, the demand for the related good goes down.</li>
<li><strong>Substitutes</strong> are two goods that used in place of each other. When the price of a substitute good rises, the quantity demanded of that good falls and the demand for related good goes up.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Changes in Tastes and Preferences</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>4. Price Expectations<br />
If we expect a price to be higher tomorrow, we are likely to buy more today to beat the price increase. The result is an increase in current demand. Likewise, if you expect a price to decline soon, you might delay your purchase to try to get a lower price in furture. An expectation of a lower price in the future will therefore decrease current demand.</p>
<p>5. The Number of Buyers<br />
Demographics changes in society are another source of shifts in demand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>countries with aging populations - the demand for baby products will decline and the demand for health care will expand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6. Taxes<br />
Changes in excise taxes (which are taxes on a single product or service) and sales taxes (which are general taxes on most goods and services) affect demand as well.</p>
<h3>What determines supply?</h3>
<p>The <strong>quantity supplied</strong> is the amount of a good or service that producers are willing and able to sell at the current price.<br />
The <strong>law of supply</strong> states that, all other things being equal, the quantity supplied of a good rises when the price rises, and falls when the price falls.</p>
<h4>The Supply Curve</h4>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>supply schedule</strong> is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied.</li>
<li>A <strong>supply curve</strong> is a graph of the relationship between the prices in the supply schedule and the quantity suppled at those prices.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Market Supply</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>market supply</strong> is the sum of the quantities supplied by each seller in a market at each price.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h4>Shift of Supply Curve</h4>
<p>A price change causes a movement along a supply curve, not a shift in the curve.</p>
<p>Figure 3.7<br />
<strong>A Shift of the Supply Curve</strong><br />
When the price changes, the quantity supplied changes along the existing supply curve, illustrated here by the orange arrow. A shift in supply occurs when something other than price changes, illustrated by the black arrows.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shift to the left</strong>: A hurricane that destroys the Colombian coffee crop causes sellers to produce less coffee.</li>
<li><strong>Shift to the right</strong>: A new way to brew a richer coffee at half the cost, causes sellers to produce more coffee.</li>
</ul>
<p>1. The Cost of Input</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input</strong> are resources used in the production process. Input may include workers, equipment, raw materials, and capital goods.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Taxes and Subsidies</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>subsidy</strong> is a payment made by the government to encourage the consumption or production of a good or service.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. The Number of Firms in the Industry</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a new pizza joint opens up nearby, more pizzas can be produced and supply expands. Conversely, if a pizza closes, the number of pizzas produced and supply contracts.</p>
</blockquote>

<li>Price Expectations</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A seller who expects a higher price for a product in the future may wich to delay sales until a time when the product will bring a higher price.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Florists know that the demand for roses spikes on Valentine's Day and Mother's Day.<br />

</blockquote>
<h3>How do supply and demand interact to create equilibrium?</h3>
<h4>Supply, Demand, and Equilibrium</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Equilibrium</strong> occurs at the point where the demand curve and the supply curve intersect.</li>
<li>The <strong>equilibrium price</strong> is the price at which the quantity supplied is equal to the quantity demanded. It is also known as the <em>market-clearing price</em>.</li>
<li>The <strong>equilibrium quantity</strong> is the amount at which the quantity supplied is equal to the quantity demanded.</li>
<li>The <strong>law of supply and demand</strong> states that the market price of any good will adjust to bring the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded into balance.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Shortages and Surplus</h5>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>shortage</strong>,or <em>excess demand</em>, occurs whenever the quantity supplied is less than the quantity demanded.</li>
<li>A <strong>surplus</strong>, or <em>excess supply</em> occurs whenever the quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded.</li>
</ul>
