> **Misconception** - Sellers determine the price of the good.

### What Are the Fundamentals of Markets?
In a **market economy**, resources are allocated among households and firms with little or no government interference.
The **invisible hand** is a phrase coined by Adam Smith to refer to the unobservable market force that guide resources to their highest-valued use.

#### Competetive Markets
A **competetive market** exists when there are so many buyers and sellers that each has only a small (negligible) impact on the market price and output.

#### Imperfect Markets
* An **imperfect market** is a market in which either the buyer or the seller can influence the market price.
* **Market power** is a firm's ability to influence the price of a good or service by exercising control over its demand, supply, or both.
* A **monopoly** exists when a single company supplies the entire market for a particular good or service.

> 2. A furniture store in an isolated small town.
> 3. A fresh produce stand at a farmes' market.

### What determines demands?
In economics, the amount of a good or service that buyers are **willing and able to purchase** at the current price is known as the **quantity demanded**.
The **law of demand** states that, all other things being equal, quantity demanded falls when the price rises, and rises when the price falls.

#### The Demand Curve
- A **demand curve** is a graph of the relationship between the prices in the demand schedule and the quantity demanded at those prices.

#### Market Demand
- The **market demand** is the sum of all the individual quantity demanded by each buyer in a market at each price.

#### Shift of Demand Curve
A price change causes a movement along a given demand curve, but it cannot cause a shift of the demand curve.

Figure 3.3
**A Shift or the Demand Curve**
When the price changes, the quantity demanded changes along the demand curve, as indicated by the orange arrow. A shift of the demand curve, indicated by the black arrows, occurs when something other than price changes.
**Shift to the left**: A health warning causes buyers to demand fewer cantaloupes.
**Shift to the right**: A medical study reports that eating cantaloupe lowers cholesterol, which cause buyers to demand more cantaloupe.

1\. Change in Buyer's Income
- **Purchasing power** is the value of your income expressed in terms of how much you can afford.
- Consumers buy more of a **normal good** as income rises, holding all other factors constant.
- An **interior good** is purchased out of necessity rater than choice.

2\. The Price of Related Goods
- **Complements** are two goods that are used together. When the price of a complementary good rises, the demand for the related good goes down.
- **Substitutes** are two goods that used in place of each other. When the price of a substitute good rises, the quantity demanded of that good falls and the demand for related good goes up.

4\. Price Expectations
If we expect a price to be higher tomorrow, we are likely to buy more today to beat the price increase. The result is an increase in current demand. Likewise, if you expect a price to decline soon, you might delay your purchase to try to get a lower price in furture. An expectation of a lower price in the future will therefore decrease current demand.

5\. The Number of Buyers
Demographics changes in society are another source of shifts in demand.
> countries with aging populations - the demand for baby products will decline and the demand for health care will expand.

6\. Taxes
Changes in excise taxes (which are taxes on a single product or service) and sales taxes (which are general taxes on most goods and services) affect demand as well.

### What determines supply?
The **quantity supplied** is the amount of a good or service that producers are willing and able to sell at the current price.
The **law of supply** states that, all other things being equal, the quantity supplied of a good rises when the price rises, and falls when the price falls.


#### The Supply Curve
- A **supply schedule** is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied.
- A **supply curve** is a graph of the relationship between the prices in the supply schedule and the quantity suppled at those prices.

#### Market Supply
- The **market supply** is the sum of the quantities supplied by each seller in a market at each price.
-
#### Shift of Supply Curve
A price change causes a movement along a supply curve, not a shift in the curve.

Figure 3.7
**A Shift of the Supply Curve**
When the price changes, the quantity supplied changes along the existing supply curve, illustrated here by the orange arrow. A shift in supply occurs when something other than price changes, illustrated by the black arrows.
- **Shift to the left**: A hurricane that destroys the Colombian coffee crop causes sellers to produce less coffee.
- **Shift to the right**: A new way to brew a richer coffee at half the cost, causes sellers to produce more coffee.

1\. The Cost of Input
- **Input** are resources used in the production process. Input may include workers, equipment, raw materials, and capital goods.

2\. Taxes and Subsidies
- A **subsidy** is a payment made by the government to encourage the consumption or production of a good or service.

3\. The Number of Firms in the Industry
> If a new pizza joint opens up nearby, more pizzas can be produced and supply expands. Conversely, if a pizza closes, the number of pizzas produced and supply contracts.

4. Price Expectations
- A seller who expects a higher price for a product in the future may wich to delay sales until a time when the product will bring a higher price.

> Florists know that the demand for roses spikes on Valentine's Day and Mother's Day.
> Economics in the real world - Why do the prices of new electronics always drop?

### How do supply and demand interact to create equilibrium?

#### Supply, Demand, and Equilibrium
- **Equilibrium** occurs at the point where the demand curve and the supply curve intersect.
- The **equilibrium price** is the price at which the quantity supplied is equal to the quantity demanded. It is also known as the *market-clearing price*.
- The **equilibrium quantity** is the amount at which the quantity supplied is equal to the quantity demanded.
- The **law of supply and demand** states that the market price of any good will adjust to bring the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded into balance.

##### Shortages and Surplus
- A **shortage**,or *excess demand*, occurs whenever the quantity supplied is less than the quantity demanded.
- A **surplus**, or *excess supply* occurs whenever the quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded.
