## 14A  The Aggregate Expenditures Model
pg461

The **aggregate expenditures model (AE)** is a **short-run** model of economic fluctuations. it holds that **prices are completely sticky (inflexible)** and that aggregate demand (aggregate expenditures) determines the economy's level of output and income.

### The Consumption of Aggregate Expenditures

#### Consumption

+ Disposable income
+ MPC - the portion of additional income that is spent on consumption (additional  likelihood to spend).
$$
MPC = \frac{\Delta \:  in \: spending}{\Delta \:  in \: income}
$$
+ Aggregate Consumption Function
$$
C = AE_0 + MPC \cdot Y
$$
where $C$ is consumption, $AE_0$ is autonomous expenditure, and $Y$ is Real GDP (income).
+ Investment
+ An Economy without Government Spending or Net Exports
+ Equilibrium without Government Spending or Net Exports
+ Equilibrium with Government Spending or Net Exports

### What Are the Implications of the AE model
1. Spending Determines Equilibrium Output and Income in the Economy
2. Equilibrium Can Occur Away from Full Employment
3. The Spending **Multiplier**
$$
\begin{aligned}
Multiplier &= \frac{1}{1- MPC}\\
initial \:  spending \times Multiplier  &= total \: spending
\end{aligned}
$$
> Example (Income Inequality)
CEO's MPC is $0.5$, and employee's MPC is $0.95$
1\. Reward CEO 1 million bonus
2\. Reward each of 10000 employees 100 dollars.

2 reasons why people spend money.
1. Autonomous expenditure (Independent of income level)
2. Induced expenditure (dependent on income)

#### Autonomous Aggregate Expenditure = Sum of all Autonomous
$$
AE_0 = C_0 + I_0 + G_0 + NX_0
$$

#### Equilibrium
Aggregate Expenditure (AE) = Income (Y) (RGDP)
$$
\begin{aligned}
AE_0 &= C_0 + I_0 + G_0 + NX_0\\
AE &= C_0 + MPC \cdot Y + I_0 + G_0 + NX_0\\
AE &= AE_0+ MPC \cdot Y\\
AE &= AE_0 \cdot \frac{1}{1-MPC}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Inequilibrium
production > expenditure $\To$ positive inventory
production < expenditure $\To$ negative inventory

Assume $AE = 5000 + 0.5Y$

| Real Income | Planned Expenditure | Production | Inventory |
|:-----------:|:-------------------:|:----------:|:---------:|
| 0     | $5000 + 0.5 \times 0 = 5000$      | 0      | -5000 |
| 4000  | $5000 + 0.5 \times 4000 = 7000$   | 4000   | -3000 |
| 10000 | $5000 + 0.5 \times 10000 = 10000$ | 10000  | 0     |
| 14000 | $5000 + 0.5 \times 14000 = 12000$ | 140000 | 2000  |
