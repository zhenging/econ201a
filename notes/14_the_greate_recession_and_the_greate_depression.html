<p>pg438-460</p>
<p><strong>Misconception</strong> - The Great Recession was comparable to the Great Depression</p>
<h3>Exactly what happened during the Great Recession and the Great Depression</h3>
<h4>The Greate Recession</h4>
<ul>
<li>18 months(December 2007 to June 2009) - longest of all recessions since WWII</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Figure 14.1 <strong>Real GDP and Unemployment Rate, Greate Recession verus All other Post-WWII Recessions</strong><br />
(a) During the Great Recession, real GDP fell further and rebounded more slowly than it otherwise did during a normal postwar recession.<br />
(b) Also, the unemployment rate rose to levels far higher than have occurred in typical postwar recessions, and it remainded high long after the rate typically falls.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>the loanable funds market</li>
<li><strong>long-run</strong> effect on aggregate supply</li>
<li><strong>Misallocation of resources</strong> during the lead-up to the Great Recession</li>
<li>The <strong>Dodd-Frank Act</strong> is the primary regulatory response to the financial turmoil that contributed to the Greate Recession.
<ul>
<li>establish new oversight bodies and regulation to reduce risk of financial markets.</li>
<li>shift the long-run <strong>Aggregate Supply</strong> left</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On Aggregate Demand Side</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Real estate values fell, the value of people's home drops (wealth)</li>
<li>Stocks lost value: retirement savings drops (wealth)</li>
<li>Expected future income (Consumer sentiment index)</li>
</ul>
<p>One reason this recession has been called &quot;Great&quot; is that the decline in real GDP and the increase in the unemployment rate were large by historical standards. Another reason is that symptoms of the recession dragged on for several year after the recession was officially over.</p>
<h4>The Great Depression</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Figure 14.7 <strong>Unemployment Rate and Real GDP for the Great Recession and the Great Depression</strong><br />
(a) During the Great Depression, real GDP fell by almost a third, and it took seven years to return to its prerecession level. In comparison, the decline in the real GDP duiring the Great recession seems meager.<br />
(b) During the Great Depression, the unemployment rate climbed to over 25% and remained over 15% for most of the entire decade of the 1930s. These levels far exceed the unemployment rates expreienced during the Great Recession.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What cause the decline in aggregate demand?<br />
Much of the decline was caused by faulty macroeconomics policy. (Fiscal and Monetary).<br />

<h3>What are the big disaggreements in macroeconomics?</h3>
<h4>Classical Economics</h4>
<p><em>Classical Economics</em> stress the importance of aggregate supply and generally believe that the economy can adjust back to full-employment equilibrium on its own.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Figure 14.9 <strong>The Classical View of the Macroeconomy</strong><br />
In the classical view, prices adjust quickly in both directions. Therefore, shifts in aggregate demand do not lead to changes in output or employment. When prices are completely flexible, aggregate demand becomes less relevant, and changed in long-run aggregate supply are considered the primary source of economic prosperity.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Keynesian Economics</h4>
<p>*Keynesian Economics *stress the importance of aggregate demand and generally believe that economy need help in moving back to full-employment equilibrium.</p>
<p>&quot;In the long run, we are all dead.&quot;</p>
